        <h1>Cheesy Buldak Ramen Casserole</h1>
        <img src="../images/casserole.jpg" alt="Image of a cheesy Casserole ">
        <p>
            This cheesy Buldak ramen casserole tames 
            the heat—a little—with the addition of creamy
             mozzarella and American cheese. It's a quick and easy bake.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>3 (4.5 ounce) packages very spicy Korean ramen, such as Buldak® Ramen, reserve seasoning packets, discard sauce packet</li>
            <li>3 cup water</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups shredded creamy mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
            <li>6 slices American cheese, such as Kraft®</li>
            <li>chili crisp, green onions, soft boiled eggs, furikake, for garnish (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>
                1 . Preheat the oven at 375 Degree F (190 C)
            </li>
            <li>
                2 . Combine uncooked ramen, 3 seasoning packets, and 3 cups water in an 8x10-inch casserole dish. Sprinkle evenly with half the mozzarella cheese; top with American cheese slices. Cover with foil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from the oven. Using tongs, gently toss ramen until liquid and cheese are combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add remaining mozzarella on top; place back into the oven and bake until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes more. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Garnish with green onions, chili crisp, furikake and soft boiled eggs if desired. Serve immediately.
